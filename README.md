## Using `screen` to Run Long-Running Processes

This guide explains how to use `screen` to run long-running Python scripts on a remote server, ensuring they continue running even if you disconnect from your SSH session.

### Step 1: Start a New `screen` Session
Create a new `screen` session with a custom name (e.g., `myproject`):

```bash
screen -S myproject
```

---

### Step 2: Run Your Python Script
Once inside the `screen` session, run your Python script:

```bash
python your_script.py
```

- This will start running your script inside the `screen` session.
- The process will continue running even if you detach from the session.

---

### Step 3: Detach from the `screen` Session
To detach from the session (leave it running in the background):

1. Press `Ctrl + A`, then `D`.

---

### Step 4: List All Active `screen` Sessions
To check which `screen` sessions are currently running:

```bash
screen -ls
```

---

### Step 5: Reattach to a `screen` Session
To reattach to a running session:

```bash
screen -r myproject
```

If you donâ€™t remember the session name, use the session ID:

```bash
screen -r 12345
```

---

### Step 6: Exit a `screen` Session
To stop the process and close the session:

1. Reattach to the session:

   ```bash
   screen -r myproject
   ```

2. Press `Ctrl + C` to stop the script.

3. Type:

   ```bash
   exit
   ```

This will completely close the `screen` session.
